  <div class="section"><b>What is this course about?</b>
    What do web search, speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation,
    autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling have in common?
    These are all complex real-world problems,
    and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these
    with rigorous mathematical tools.
    In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these
    applications and practice implementing some of these systems.  Specific
    topics include machine learning, search, game playing, Markov decision
    processes, constraint satisfaction, graphical models, and logic.
    The main goal of the course is to equip you with the tools to tackle new
    AI problems you might encounter in life.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Prerequisites:</b>
    This course is fast-paced and covers a lot of ground,
    so it is important that you have a solid foundation on both the theoretical and empirical fronts.
    You should have taken the following classes (or their equivalents):
    <ul>
      <li>Programming (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/">CS 106A</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/">CS 106B</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs107/">CS 107</a>)</li>
      <li>Discrete math (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/">CS 103</a>)</li>
      <li>Probability (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs109/">CS 109</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Reading:</b>
    There is no required textbook for this class, and you should be able to
    learn everything from the lecture notes and homeworks.
    However, if you would like to pursue more advanced topics or get another
    perspective on the same material, here are some books:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu">Russell and Norvig.  Artificial
        Intelligence: A Modern Approach.</a> A comprehensive reference for
      all the AI topics that we will cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models">Koller and Friedman.  Probabilistic Graphical Models.</a>
        Covers factor graphs and Bayesian networks (this is the textbook for CS228).</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning">Sutton and Barto.  Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.</a>
        Covers Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning.  Available free online.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.  The elements of statistical learning.</a>
        Covers machine learning.  Available free online.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.bracil.net/edward/fcs.html">Tsang.  Foundations of constraint satisfaction.</a>
        Covers constraint satisfaction problems.  Available free online.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Bear in mind that some of these books can be quite dense and use different
    notation terminology, so it might take some effort to connect up with the
    material from class.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Homeworks</b> (60%):
    There will be weekly homeworks with both written and programming parts.
    Each homework is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts.
    Some homeworks will have a competition component; winners will receive extra credit.
    Here are all the homework deadlines:
    <p><div id="homeworks"></div></p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Exam</b> (20%): The exam is a three-hour written exam that will
    test your knowledge and problem-solving skills on all preceding lectures and homeworks.
    You cannot use any external aids
    except one double-sided page of notes.
    If you have a major conflict (e.g., an academic conference),
    <a href="TODO">submit a request</a> to take it at another (earlier) time.

    <li><b><a href="project.html">Project</a></b> (20%): The final project provides an opportunity for you to
    use the tools from class to build something interesting of your choice.
    Projects should be done in groups of up to three.
    The project will be something that you work on throughout the course and we have set up some milestones
    to help you along the way:
    <p><div id="projects"></div></p>
    See <a href="project.html">the project page</a> for more details.
    <p>
    Regardless of the group size, all groups must submit the same basic amount of work as detailed in each milestone.
    Of course, the experiments may not always be successful,
    so we will cut the smaller groups more slack,
    while larger groups are expected to be more thorough in their experiments.
    </p>
    <p>For inspiration, we have made <a href="TODO">previous CS221 projects</a> available for viewing. [TODO: put in a separate github repo]</p>

    <li><b>Piazza</b>:
    You will be awarded with up to 2% extra credit
    if you answer other students' questions in a substantial and helpful way.
  </ul>

  <p class="subheader">Assignments</p>

  <div class="section"><b>Written assignments:</b>
    Homeworks should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers
    are unclear or unnecessarily complicated.
    Here is an <a href="homework-example.html">example</a> of what we are looking for.
    You are encouraged to use LaTeX to writeup your homeworks
    (here's a <a href="homework.tex">template</a>), but this is not a requirement. You will receive
    <b>one (1) bonus point</b> for submitting a typed written assignment (e.g. LaTeX, Microsoft Word).
    We will accept scanned handwritten assignments but they will not receive the bonus point.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Programming assignments:</b>
    The grader runs on Python 2.7, which is not guaranteed to work with newer versions (Python 3) or older versions (below 2.7).
    Please use <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 2.7</a> to develop your code.
    <p>
    The programming assignments are designed to be run
    in <b>GNU/Linux</b> environments, such
    as <strong><a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sharedcomputing/environments">cardinal.stanford.edu</a></strong> [TODO: gradescope].
    Most or all of the grading code may incidentally work on other
    systems such as MacOS or Windows, and students may optionally
    choose to do most of their development in one of these alternative
    environments. However, no technical support will be provided for
    issues that only arise on an alternative environment.  Moreover,
    no matter what environment is used during development, students
    must confirm that their code (specifically, the original <code>grader.py</code> script
    operating on the student's <code>submission.py</code>) runs
    on <code>cardinal.stanford.edu</code>, and must submit their
    assignments from <code>cardinal.stanford.edu</code> as well.  The
    final grading will be run on GNU/Linux servers.

    <p>
    The submitted code will <b>not</b> be graded if it has one of the following issues:
    <ul>
      <li>The original <code>grader.py</code> script (operating on the
          submitted <code>submission.py</code>) does not <b>exit normally</b>
          on <code>cardinal.stanford.edu</code>.  Note that calls such as <code>quit()</code>, <code>exit()</code>,
        <code>sys.exit()</code>, <code>os._exit()</code> may cause the program to exit <b>abnormally</b>, as may excessive resource usage.
	Also note that Python packages outside the standard library are not guaranteed to work.</li>
      <li>The code reads external resources other than the files given in the assignment.
      <li>The code is malicious. This is considered a violation of the honor code.
          The score of the assignment will be zero (0) and the incident will be reported to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Collaboration policy and honor code:</b>
    You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects.
    However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently, and you must acknowledge in your submission all the students you discussed with.
    The following are considered to be honor code violations:
    <ul>
      <li>Looking at the writeup or code of another student.</li>
      <li>Showing your writeup or code to another student.</li>
      <li>Discussing homework problems in such detail that your solution (writeup or code) is almost identical to another student's answer.</li>
      <li>Uploading your writeup or code to a public repository (e.g. github, bitbucket, pastebin) so that it can be accessed by other students.</li>
      <li>Looking at solutions from previous years' homeworks - either official or written up by another student.</li>
    </ul>
    When debugging code together, you are only allowed to look at the input-output behavior
    of each other's programs (so you should write good test cases!).
    It is important to remember that even if you didn't copy but just gave
    another student your solution, you are still violating the honor code, so please be careful.
    We periodically run similarity-detection software over all
    submitted student programs, including programs from past quarters and any
    solutions found online on public websites.
    Anyone violating the <a
      href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/student-conduct-process/honor-code-and-fundamental-standard">honor
      code</a> will be referred to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
    If you feel like you made a mistake (it can happen, especially under time
    pressure!), please reach out to the instructor or the head CA;
    the consequences will be much less severe than if we approach you.
  </div>

  <p class="subheader">Submission</p>

  <div class="section"><b>Electronic Submission:</b>
    All assignments (homework problems and project milestones) must be submitted using the submit script by
    <b><font color="red">11pm</font> (23:00, not 23:59) Pacific time</b>.
    <p>To submit: [TODO: gradescope instructions]</p>
    <p>
    You are allowed to submit an assignment a maximum of <b>ten (10)</b> times.
    Each submission will replace the previous.
    <p>
    Since we do not accept the assignments from other submission methods (e.g., email),
    please make sure you can use the submit script. Do not wait until the deadline.
    If anything goes wrong, please ask a question on Piazza or contact a course assistant.
    Do not email us your submission.
    <b>Partial work is better than not submitting any work.</b>
    <p>
    For assignments with a programming component, we will automatically
    sanity check your code in some basic test cases, but we will grade
    your code on additional test cases.
    <b>Important</b>: just because you pass the basic test cases, you are by no
    means guaranteed to get full credit on the other test cases, so you should
    test the program more thoroughly yourself!
    <p>
    Unless the assignment instructs otherwise, all of your code modifications
    should be in <code>submission.py</code> and all of your written answers
    in <code>&lt;assignment ID&gt;.pdf</code>.
    <p>
    For the project milestones, make sure the <b>same one member</b> of your
    group submits on behalf of the entire group.  The submission should include a
    <code>group.txt</code> file which should contain the <b>SUNetIDs</b> of the entire
    group, one per line. Do not include your names!
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Late days:</b>
    [TODO: update logic]
    An assignment is $\lceil d \rceil$ days late if it is turned in $d$ fractional days late
    (note that this means if you are $1$ second late, $d = 1/(24 \times 60 \times 60)$ and it is 1 day late).
    You have <b>eight (8) late days</b>
    in total that can be distributed among the assignments (except for p-poster, p-peer, and p-final)
    without penalty</b>.
    There is a maximum of <b>two (2) late days</b> that can be used per assignment.
    If you exceed this limit by $k$ hours,
    then you will incur a multiplicative penalty factor of $\max(1 - k/5, 0)$.
    For example, if you get $40$ points and turn in your homework 2 days + 1.5 hours after the deadline,
    then your effective score is $40(1 - 1.5/5) = 28$.
    If you exceed $5$ hours, you will receive $0$ points.
    You get a zero after all your late days run out, but we reserve the right to give partial credit in extenuating circumstances.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Regrades</b>: If you believe that the course
    staff made an objective error in grading, then you may submit a
    regrade request. Remember that even if the grading seems harsh to
    you, the same rubric was used for everyone for fairness, so this
    is not sufficient justification for a regrade.
